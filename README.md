<h1>To assist with easier, digital management of inventory and sales</h1><br>
The Inventory management system will help companies keep a track of their inventory and different kind of products. The application wil hold important details about the Inventory on hand like its name, cost, selling price and quantity available in the facility. The user will be able to add, delete, view and search through the entire list of products that the company has in hand. In addition, the application will also be able to track the sales and revenue that is being generated and simultaneously deduct the amount inventory available after each sale. There would an added alert feature that would notify the user when the stock of a particular item would fall beyond a particular low level so that the company can timely order it to meet demand. The application will remove the need to manually keep a track of the inventory and will digitize the procedure for companies. The users of this application will be the inventory managers of companies or even proprietors if it is a small company beginning to grow. This project relates to my fathers business as he too trades commodities from warehouses and has told me about the issues of keep track of it manually or without a application. This motivated me to try and create a solution myself. Hence, I chose to do the project on this topic.

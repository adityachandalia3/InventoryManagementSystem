# Inventory Management System

## To assist with easier, digital management of inventory and sales


The Inventory management system will help companies keep a track of their inventory and different kind of products. The
application wil hold important details about the Inventory on hand like its **name, cost, selling price and quantity** 
**available** in the facility. The user will be able to **add, delete, view and search** through the entire list of
products that the company has in hand. In addition, the application will also be able to **track the sales and revenue**
that is being generated and simultaneously deduct the amount inventory available after each sale. There would an added
**alert feature that** would notify the user when the stock of a particular item would fall beyond a particular low level
so that the company can timely order it to meet demand. The application will **remove the need to manually keep a track
of the inventory** and will digitize the procedure for companies.
The users of this application will be the inventory managers of companies or even proprietors if it is a small company
beginning to grow. This project relates to my fathers business as he too trades commodities from warehouses and has told
me about the issues of keep track of it manually or without a application. This motivated me to try and create a
solution myself. Hence, I chose to do the project on this topic.

# Phase 4: Task 3
- One thing that i would like to change is probably splitting up my MainWindow UI class into several other small 
classes to make the code more readable and understandable.
- i would also make the UI more attractive and divide into seperate windows instead of having just one window
- With regards to duplication, I think it will be very difficult to reduce it because all classes may behave differently
but all their implementation and functions are so different that its very difficult to add some additional abstraction
